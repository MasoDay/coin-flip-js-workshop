## Requirements

- [Node.js & npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [near-cli](https://docs.near.org/docs/tools/near-cli) `v3.1.1` or greater

```bash
npm i -g near-cli
```

---

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

2. Launch dApp! ðŸš€

```bash
npm run start
```

> This script performs the following:
>
> - Compiles smart contract located in `./src/index.js` and exports to `./build/contract.base64`
> - Creates a NEAR [`dev-account`](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/account#dev-accounts) with 200 â“ƒ `testnet` tokens. _(If it doesn't already exist)_
> - Deploys the compiled smart contract to the `dev-account` on NEAR's [`testnet`](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/networks#testnet)
> - Launches a local front-end that is connected to the smart contract (dApp)

---

## Exploring the code

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ utils
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js  <------[ Smart Contract ]
â”œâ”€â”€ babel.config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md

```

## Smart Contract

> As illustrated above, the [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) is located in `./src/index.js`.

Here you will see a few dependencies imported from `near-sdk-js` that is used for the creation of a smart contract.

- `NearBindgen`
  - This decorator allows the JS code to be compiled to WebAssembly; a format that is compatible with the NEAR blockchain.
- `NearContract`
  - A constructing class for creating smart contracts in the proper format
- `call`
  - A decorator that indicates a `change` method or a function that changes state on the blockchain. Note that change methods cost gas and must be signed. For more information see our [documentation on gas](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/gas).
- `view`
  - A decorator that indicates a `view` method or a function that returns values stored on the blockchain. View calls are free and do not cost gas.

## Frontend

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js      <------- Core logic for the application
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ css
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ img
â”œâ”€â”€ config.js   <------- Contract ID & various network environment settings
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â””â”€â”€ utils.js    <------- Contract initialization, NEAR Wallet setup, & dApp functions
```

> A simple [React](https://reactjs.org/) front end that uses [`near-api-js`](https://github.com/near/near-api-js) to connect to the NEAR blockchain.

## Example Game

> In this example repo there are several other branches with different completed contracts that you can use to help you learn:

- `coin-flip-skeleton` contains the skeleton code for the coin flipping game
- `coin-flip-finished` contains the finished code for the coin flipping game
- `coin-flip-hub` contains the finished code for the hub contract.

The actual on-chain interactions take place in the `flip_coin` and `get_points` functions defined in `frontend/utils/utils.js`.

To test the fully working contract alongside the frontend, switch to the `coin-flip-finished` branch and follow the steps outlined in the [Quickstart](#quick-start) section.
